Project 1 — Basic Strands + Ollama Agent

This project is a minimal working example of using the Strands Agent SDK with a local Ollama model.
It demonstrates how to:

Create a Strands agent

Connect it to a local Ollama model (gemma3:1b or any installed model)

Run a prompt

Access agent metrics such as token usage and execution time

This is the foundation for more advanced Strands experiments in later projects.
