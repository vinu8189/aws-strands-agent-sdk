# aws-strands-agent-sdk

A collection of hands-on experiments using the Strands Agent SDK with local Ollama models. Each project explores a different capability—basic agent interactions, tool integration, metrics tracking, and observability. This repo documents my learning journey while building intelligent, local-first AI agents with Python.
