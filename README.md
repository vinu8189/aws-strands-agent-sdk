# aws-strands-agent-sdk

A collection of hands-on experiments using the **Strands Agent SDK** with **local Ollama models**. Each project explores a specific capability—basic agent interactions, tool usage, reasoning metrics, local observability, and OpenTelemetry integrations.

This repository documents my learning journey in building **local-first, intelligent AI agents** with Python. The structure is project-based, allowing each experiment to stand on its own while forming a broader roadmap toward production-grade agent development.

### What this repo covers

* Using the Strands Agent SDK with local LLMs
* Creating agents, prompting, and reading execution metrics
* Designing basic RAG-style pipelines (retrieval + generation on local data)
* Adding tools so agents can act more autonomously (call functions, APIs, and utilities)
* Integrating Strands tools and multi-step reasoning
* Observability fundamentals (metrics, logs, traces)
* Preparing agents for external telemetry dashboards (Dash0, Grafana, OTEL Collector)

### Future plans

* Add more advanced agent examples (tools, multi-step reasoning, RAG)
* Containerize agents with Docker and experiment with local deployment patterns
* Explore scaling and monitoring options for local-first agents
* Add small utilities, helper scripts, and reusable templates
* Document learnings, trade-offs, and architectural insights as the projects grow

This is an evolving repository intended for continuous experimentation, learning, and improvement.
