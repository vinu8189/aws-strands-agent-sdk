# aws-strands-agent-sdk

A collection of hands-on experiments using the **Strands Agent SDK** with **local Ollama models**. Each project explores a specific capability—basic agent interactions, tool usage, reasoning metrics, local observability, and OpenTelemetry integrations.

This repository documents my learning journey in building **local-first, intelligent AI agents** with Python. The structure is project-based, allowing each experiment to stand on its own while forming a broader roadmap toward production-grade agent development.

### What this repo covers

* Using the Strands Agent SDK with local LLMs
* Creating agents, prompting, and reading execution metrics
* Integrating Strands tools and multi-step reasoning
* Observability fundamentals (metrics, logs, traces)
* Preparing agents for external telemetry dashboards (Dash0, Grafana, OTEL Collector)

### Future plans

* Add more advanced agent examples
* Include OpenTelemetry pipelines and dashboards
* Explore secure deployment patterns for local agents
* Add small utilities, helper scripts, and reusable templates
* Document learnings and architectural insights as the projects grow

This is an evolving repository intended for continuous experimentation, learning, and improvement.
